### Best Practices for Writing High-Performing SQL Queries

1. **Select Only Relevant Columns**: Retrieve only the necessary data to reduce overhead and improve query efficiency.
  
2. **Avoid Unwanted Subqueries**: Replace subqueries with joins or functions when possible to optimize query performance.
  
3. **Use Proper Indexes**: Implement appropriate indexes to accelerate search operations and improve query execution time.
  
4. **Handle NULL Values**: Anticipate and manage NULLs to ensure accurate and reliable query results.

5. **Use Table Aliases**: Apply aliases for tables when using multiple sources to enhance readability, maintainability, and ensure correct column references.

6. **Avoid Column Numbers in ORDER BY**: Use column names instead of numbers in the `ORDER BY` clause to maintain scalability and prevent issues when modifying SELECT statements.

7. **Specify Columns in INSERT Statements**: Always list columns explicitly in `INSERT` statements to avoid problems with NULL values and make tracking changes easier.

8. **Avoid Double Quotes in T-SQL**: Use single quotes instead of double quotes to prevent potential syntax errors.

9. **Don't Prefix Stored Procedures with "sp_"**: Avoid using "sp_" as it is reserved for system procedures. Use unique naming conventions for stored procedures to differentiate them clearly.

10. **Use SET NOCOUNT ON**: In stored procedures and triggers, use `SET NOCOUNT ON` to stop the message indicating the number of rows affected by a T-SQL statement, reducing unnecessary network traffic.

11. **Optimize Joins**: Ensure that joins are performed on indexed columns and avoid joining on large datasets without proper filtering.

12. **Avoid Wildcards at the Beginning of LIKE Patterns**: If using the `LIKE` operator, avoid placing wildcards at the beginning of the pattern to allow indexes to be used effectively.

13. **Consider Using Temporary Tables or CTEs**: For complex queries, break them down using temporary tables or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to improve readability and manageability.

14. **Regularly Rebuild or Reorganize Indexes**: Keep indexes optimized by regularly rebuilding or reorganizing them to prevent fragmentation and maintain performance.

15. **Monitor Query Performance with Execution Plans**: Regularly review execution plans to identify bottlenecks and areas where performance can be improved.
